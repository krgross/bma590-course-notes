# Smooth regression



## Loess smoothers

We will illustrate LOESS smoothers with the bioluminescence data found in the ISIT data set.  These data are featured in @zuur2009, and can be found by visiting the webpage associated with the book.  A link to this webpage appears on the course website.  The data were originally reported in @gillibrand2007seasonal, and detail the number of sources of bioluminescence detected along a depth gradient in the North Atlantic.  The name of the data set ("ISIT") refers to the type of camera used in the study.

The methods that we discuss in this chapter allow a flexible specification of how the predictor(s) are associated with the mean response.  All of the methods we discuss are variations on regression.  As such, they inherent all of the usual regression assumptions about the distribution of the errors, namely, that the errors are iid draws from a Gaussian distribution.

Unfortunately, the bioluminescence data discussed in this chapter violate these assumptions rather severely. We will see right away that the data display the usual non-constant variance that we expect when measuring an ecological abundance, namely, larger responses are also more variable.  In addition, because these data are collected at locations along a transect, they are likely characterized by substantial autocorrelation.  For the sake of illustration, we ignore both the non-constant variance and the autocorrelation in the analyses that follow.  See the discussion of [GAMMs] to learn about coping with autocorrelation in generalized additive models.


```r
## download the data from the book's website

isit <- read.table("data/ISIT.txt", head = T)

## extract the data from station 16

st16 <- subset(isit, Station == 16)

## retain just the variables that we want, and rename

st16 <- st16[, c("SampleDepth", "Sources")]
names(st16) <- c("depth", "sources")
with(st16, plot(sources ~ depth))
```

Fit a loess smoother using the factory settings:


```r
st16.lo <- loess(sources ~ depth, data = st16)
summary(st16.lo)
```

```
## Call:
## loess(formula = sources ~ depth, data = st16)
## 
## Number of Observations: 51 
## Equivalent Number of Parameters: 4.33 
## Residual Standard Error: 4.18 
## Trace of smoother matrix: 4.73  (exact)
## 
## Control settings:
##   span     :  0.75 
##   degree   :  2 
##   family   :  gaussian
##   surface  :  interpolate	  cell = 0.2
##   normalize:  TRUE
##  parametric:  FALSE
## drop.square:  FALSE
```

Plot the fit, this takes a little work

```r
depth.vals <- with(st16, seq(from   = min(depth), 
                             to     = max(depth), 
                             length = 100))

st16.fit <- predict(object  = st16.lo,
                    newdata = depth.vals,
                    se      = TRUE)

with(st16, plot(sources ~ depth))
lines(x = depth.vals, y = st16.fit$fit, col = "blue")

# add 95% error bars
lines(x   = depth.vals, 
      y   = st16.fit$fit + st16.fit$se.fit * qt(p = .975, df = st16.fit$df),
      col = "blue",
      lty = "dashed")

lines(x   = depth.vals, 
      y   = st16.fit$fit - st16.fit$se.fit * qt(p = .975, df = st16.fit$df),
      col = "blue",
      lty = "dashed")
```

<img src="04-SmoothRegression_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="672" />

Examine the residuals:

```r
## see what the fit returns; maybe the residuals are already there

names(st16.lo)  # they are!
```

```
##  [1] "n"         "fitted"    "residuals" "enp"       "s"         "one.delta"
##  [7] "two.delta" "trace.hat" "divisor"   "robust"    "pars"      "kd"       
## [13] "call"      "terms"     "xnames"    "x"         "y"         "weights"
```

```r
plot(st16.lo$residuals ~ st16$depth)
abline(h = 0, lty = "dotted")
```

<img src="04-SmoothRegression_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="672" />

Let's look at how changing the span changes the fit.  We'll write a custom function to fit a LOESS curve, and then call the function with various values for the span.


```r
PlotLoessFit <- function(x, y, return.fit = FALSE, ...){
  
  # Caluclates a loess fit with the 'loess' function, and makes a plot
  #
  # Args:
  #   x: predictor
  #   y: response
  #   return.fit: logical
  #   ...: Optional arguments to loess
  #
  # Returns:
  #   the loess fit
  
  my.lo <- loess(y ~ x, ...)
  
  x.vals <- seq(from = min(x), to = max(x), length = 100)
  
  my.fit <- predict(object  = my.lo,
                    newdata = x.vals,
                    se      = TRUE)
  
  plot(x, y)
  lines(x = x.vals, y = my.fit$fit, col = "blue")
  
  lines(x   = x.vals, 
        y   = my.fit$fit + my.fit$se.fit * qt(p = .975, df = my.fit$df),
        col = "blue",
        lty = "dashed")
  
  lines(x   = x.vals, 
        y   = my.fit$fit - my.fit$se.fit * qt(p = .975, df = my.fit$df),
        col = "blue",
        lty = "dashed")
  
  if (return.fit) {
    return(my.lo)
  }
}
```

Now we'll call the function several times, each time chanigng the value of the `span` argument to the `loess` function:


```r
PlotLoessFit(x = st16$depth, y = st16$sources, span = 0.5)
```

<img src="04-SmoothRegression_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="672" />

```r
PlotLoessFit(x = st16$depth, y = st16$sources, span = 0.25)
```

<img src="04-SmoothRegression_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-2.png" width="672" />

```r
PlotLoessFit(x = st16$depth, y = st16$sources, span = 0.1)
```

<img src="04-SmoothRegression_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-3.png" width="672" />

Let's try a loess fit with a locally linear regression:


```r
PlotLoessFit(x = st16$depth, y = st16$sources, span = 0.25, degree = 1)
```

<img src="04-SmoothRegression_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="672" />

## Splines

We'll use the `gam` function in the `mgcv` package to fit splines and additive models.  The name of the package is an acronym for "Mixed GAM Computation Vehicle".  GAM is an acronym for Generalized Additive Model.  **Warning**.  I do not understand much of the functionality of `mgcv::gam`.  What follows is my best guess of how the procedure works.

The code below fits a regression spline to the bioluminescence data.  Actually, the code fits an additive model with the spline as the only predictor. We will say more about additive models later.  For now, we can define an additive model as a type of regression in which the linear effect of the predictor has been replaced by a spline.  In other words, in terms of a word equation, the model can be represented as
$$
\mbox{response = intercept + spline + error}
$$

The `s()` component of the model formula designates a spline, and specifies details about the particular type of spline to be fit.  The `fx = TRUE` component of the formula indicates that the amount of smoothing is fixed.  The default value for the `fx` argument is `fx = FALSE`, in which case the amount of smoothing is determined by (generalized) cross-validation.  When `fx = TRUE`, the parameter `k` determines the dimensionality (degree of flexibility) of the spline.  Larger values of `k` correspond to greater flexibility, and a less smooth fit.  For cubic splines, the number of knots is $k-4$, such that setting $k=4$ fits a familiar cubic polynomial with no knots.  Setting $k=5$ then fits a cubic regression spline with one knot, etc.  I believe that the knots are placed at the empirical quantiles of the data.  In other words, a regression spline with one knot places the knot at the median value of the predictor.  A regression spline with three knots ($k=7$) places the knots at the lower quartile, the median, and the upper quartile of the predictor, and so on.

We'll fit a cubic regression spline with two knots:


```r
library(mgcv)
```

```
## Loading required package: nlme
```

```
## This is mgcv 1.9-0. For overview type 'help("mgcv-package")'.
```

```r
st16.rspline <- mgcv::gam(sources ~ s(depth, k = 6, fx = TRUE), data = st16)
plot(st16.rspline, se = TRUE)
```

<img src="04-SmoothRegression_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="672" />

Note that the plot includes only the portion of the model attributable to the covariate effect.  This is because we have actually fit an additive model (e.g., a GAM).  

The plot shows only the spline component, which thus does not include the intercept. To visualize the fit, we'll need to do a bit more work.

```r
with(st16, plot(sources ~ depth))  

st16.fit <- predict(st16.rspline, 
                    newdata = data.frame(depth = depth.vals), 
                    se      = TRUE)

lines(x = depth.vals, y = st16.fit$fit)

## use 45 df because the estimate of the residual error is based on 51-6 = 45 df

lines(x = depth.vals, y = st16.fit$fit + qt(0.975, df = 45) * st16.fit$se.fit, lty = "dashed")
lines(x = depth.vals, y = st16.fit$fit + qt(0.025, df = 45) * st16.fit$se.fit, lty = "dashed")
```

<img src="04-SmoothRegression_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" width="672" />

We see that this particular fit is not flexible enough to capture the trend in luminescence at shallow depth.

Let's take a look at the information produced by a call to `summary`:


```r
summary(st16.rspline)
```

```
## 
## Family: gaussian 
## Link function: identity 
## 
## Formula:
## sources ~ s(depth, k = 6, fx = TRUE)

## s(depth)   5      5 122.6  <2e-16 ***
## ---
## Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1
## 
## R-sq.(adj) =  0.924   Deviance explained = 93.2%
## GCV = 19.837  Scale est. = 17.503    n = 51
```

This summary requires a bit more explanation as well.  In this GAM, the spline component of the model effectively creates a set of new predictor variables.  A cubic regression spline with $x$ internal knots requires $x+3$ new regression predictors to fit the spline.  In this fit, there are two internal knots, so the spline requires 5 new predictor variables. Because the predictors are determined in advance with regression splines, we can use the usual theory of $F$-tests from regression to assess the statistical significance of the spline terms.  In the section of the output labeled "Approximate significance of smooth terms", we see that these 5 predictors together provide a significantly better fit than a model that does not include the spline.  This test is exact.  It is labeled "approximate" because the default behavior of `mgcv::gam` is to fit a *penalized* regression spline, for which the test is indeed only approximate.  

Now we'll fit and plot a penalized regression spline.  A penalized regression spline is based on a regression spline with a large number of knots, but the fit is obtained using a penalty that penalizes the "wiggliness" of the fit.  When the underlying regression spline is a cubic spline, the wiggliness is defined as the intergral of the squared second derivative of the fit.  The most appropriate value for the penalty is determined by (generalized) cross validation.  In this way, the penalized regression spline automatically determines the appropriate amount of smoothness.  We still have to specify $k$ to make sure that the initial regression spline has enough flexibility.


```r
st16.spline <- mgcv::gam(sources ~ s(depth, k = 20), data = st16)
plot(st16.spline, se = TRUE)  # note that the plot does not include the intercept
```

<img src="04-SmoothRegression_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png" width="672" />

Again, we make a plot that includes both the points and the fit


```r
with(st16, plot(sources ~ depth))  

st16.fit <- predict(st16.spline, 
                    newdata = data.frame(depth = depth.vals), 
                    se      = TRUE)

lines(x = depth.vals, y = st16.fit$fit)

lines(x = depth.vals, y = st16.fit$fit + qt(0.975, df = 51 - 13.41) * st16.fit$se.fit, lty = "dashed")
lines(x = depth.vals, y = st16.fit$fit + qt(0.025, df = 51 - 13.41) * st16.fit$se.fit, lty = "dashed")
```

<img src="04-SmoothRegression_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png" width="672" />

Let's ask for a summary:

```r
summary(st16.spline)
```

```
## 
## Family: gaussian 
## Link function: identity 
## 
## Formula:
## sources ~ s(depth, k = 20)
## 
## Parametric coefficients:
##             Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)    
## (Intercept)  12.4771     0.3222   38.73   <2e-16 ***
## ---
## Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1
## 
## Approximate significance of smooth terms:
##            edf Ref.df     F p-value    
## s(depth) 12.41  14.31 148.6  <2e-16 ***
## ---
## Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1
## 
## R-sq.(adj) =  0.977   Deviance explained = 98.3%
## GCV = 7.1813  Scale est. = 5.2928    n = 51
```

Note the `edf` component in the "Approximate significance of smooth terms" section.  The label `edf` stands for effective degrees of freedom.  We can think of the edf as the effective number of new predictors that have been added to the model to accommodate the spline.  For a penalized regression spline, the number and values of the newly created predictors are determined by fitting the model to the data.  Because the predictors are calculated in this way, the usual theory of $F$-testing does not apply.  This is why the $F$-test shown for the penalized regression spline is labeled as "approximate".  

Find the AIC for the penalized regression spline fit:


```r
AIC(st16.spline)
```

```
## [1] 242.9773
```
Here's a small detail.  Notice that the syntax of the call to `predict` is slightly different when making a prediction for a `loess`  object vs.\ making a prediction for a `gam` object (which the spline fit is).  For a call to `predict` with a `loess` object, the new predictor values can be provided in the form of a vector.  So, we were able to use

```r
depth.vals <- with(st16, seq(from   = min(depth), 
                             to     = max(depth), 
                             length = 100))

st16.fit <- predict(object  = st16.lo,
                    newdata = depth.vals,
                    se      = TRUE)
```

However, for a call to `predict` with a `gam` object, the new predictor values must be provided in the form of a new data frame, with variable names that match the variables in the `gam` model.  So, to get predicted values for the spline fit, we needed to use the more cumbersome


```r
depth.vals <- with(st16, seq(from   = min(depth), 
                             to     = max(depth), 
                             length = 100))

st16.fit <- predict(st16.spline, 
                    newdata = data.frame(depth = depth.vals), 
                    se      = TRUE)
```

## Generalized additive models (GAMs) {#GAMs}

Generalized additive models replace the usual linear terms that appear in multiple regression models with splines.  That is, suppose we seek to model the relationship between a response $y$ and two predictors, $x_1$ and $x_2$.  A standard regression model without polynomial effects or interactions would be written as 
$$
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 +\beta_2 x_2 + \varepsilon
$$
where $\varepsilon$ is assumed to be an iid Gaussian random variate with variance $\sigma^2_\varepsilon$.  This is an additive model, in the sense that the combined effects of the two predictors equal the sum of their individual effects.  

A generalized additive model (GAM) replaces the individual regression terms with splines.  Continuing with the generic example, a GAM would instead model the effects of the two predictors as
$$
y = \beta_0 + s(x_1) +s(x_2) + \varepsilon
$$
where $s(\cdot)$ represents a spline.  We continue to assume that, conditional on the covariate effects, the responses are normally distributed with constant variance $\sigma^2_\varepsilon$.  

We will illustrate additive modeling using the bird data found in Appendix A of @zuur2009.  Zuur et al. report that these data originally appeared in @loyn1987effects and were featured in Quinn & Keough (2002)'s text.  Zuur et al. describe these data in the following way:

> Forest bird densities were measured in 56 forest patches in south-eastern Victoria, Australia. The aim of the study was to relate bird densities to six habitat variables; size of the forest patch, distance to the nearest patch, distance to the nearest larger patch, mean altitude of the patch, year of isolation by clearing, and an index of stock grazing history (1 = light, 5 = intensive).

We first read the data and perform some light exploratory analysis and housekeeping.


```r

Our first attempt at a GAM will use penalized regression splines for all of the continuous predictors in the model.  We will use a linear term for GRAZE because there are too few unique values to support a smooth term:

```r
bird.gam1 <- mgcv::gam(ABUND ~ s(L.AREA, k = 10) + s(L.DIST, k = 10) + s(L.LDIST, k = 10) + s(YR.ISOL, k = 10) + GRAZE + s(ALT, k = 10), data = bird)

The output reports the partial regression coefficient for the lone quantitative predictor GRAZE, and approximate significance tests for the smooth terms for each of the other predictors.  We can visualize these smooth terms with a call to `plot`:

```r
plot(bird.gam1)
```

In the interest of time, we take a casual approach to variable selection here.  We'll drop smooth terms that are clearly not significant to obtain:

```r
bird.gam2 <- mgcv::gam(ABUND ~ s(L.AREA, k = 10) + GRAZE, data = bird)
summary(bird.gam2)
```

Note that the GRAZE variable is currently treated as a numerical predictor.  We'll try fitting a model with GRAZE as a factor.  First we'll create a new variable that treats GRAZE as a factor.  We'll use the `summary` command to confirm that the new variable fGRAZE is indeed a factor.

```r
bird$fGRAZE <- as.factor(bird$GRAZE)
summary(bird)
```

```

Now we'll proceed to fit the model

bird.gam3 <- gam(ABUND ~ s(L.AREA, k = 10) + fGRAZE, data = bird)
plot(bird.gam3)
```

To formally compare the models with GRAZE as a numerical vs.\ categorical predictor, we'll have to use AIC.  We can't use an $F$-test here because we have used penalized regression splines to capture the effect of L.AREA.  Thus, the models are not nested.  (If we had used regression splines for L.AREA, then the models would have been nested.)  We can extract the AICs for these models by a simple call to the `AIC` function.


```r
AIC(bird.gam2)
```

```
## [1] 367.1413
```

```r
AIC(bird.gam3)
```

```
## [1] 361.9655
```

<!-- Compare the design matrices for these two models (only the first few rows of each matrix are shown in this transcript): -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- head(model.matrix(bird.gam3)) -->
<!-- head(model.matrix(bird.gam4)) -->
<!-- ``` -->
We can see the contrasts used to incorporate the factor fGRAZE in the model by a call to `contrasts`:

```r
with(bird, contrasts(fGRAZE))
```

```
##   2 3 4 5
## 1 0 0 0 0
## 2 1 0 0 0
## 3 0 1 0 0
## 4 0 0 1 0
## 5 0 0 0 1
```

The output here is somewhat opaque because the levels of fGRAZE are 1, 2, $\ldots$, 5.  The output of the call to `contrasts` shows each of the newly created indicator variables as a column.  For example, the first column shows that the predictor named `fGRAZE2` takes the value of 1 when the variable fGRAZE equals 2, and is 0 otherwise.

Fit an additive model with only a smooth effect of L.AREA, in order to show residuals vs.\ GRAZE:

```r
bird.gam4 <- gam(ABUND ~ s(L.AREA, k = 10), data = bird)

plot(x = bird$GRAZE, y = bird.gam4$residuals)
abline(h = 0, lty = "dashed")
```

<img src="04-SmoothRegression_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-26-1.png" width="672" />

Both the plot and the model output suggest that the effect of grazing is primarily due to lower bird abundance in the most heavily grazed category.

To conclude, we'll conduct a formal test of whether the model with GRAZE as a factor provides a significantly better fit than the model with a linear effect of GRAZE.  In this case, we have to use regression splines for the smooth effect of L.AREA.  We'll use regression "splines" without any internal knots^[I would have thought that a spline without any internal knots would have been exactly the same as a cubic fit.  However, a cubic fit is slightly different, though not by much.  I can't figure out why.] because the effect of log area seems to be reasonably well captured by a cubic trend anyway:

```r
bird.gam5 <- gam(ABUND ~ s(L.AREA, k = 4, fx = TRUE) + GRAZE, data = bird)
bird.gam6 <- gam(ABUND ~ s(L.AREA, k = 4, fx = TRUE) + fGRAZE, data = bird)

anova(bird.gam5, bird.gam6, test = "F")  
```

```
## Analysis of Deviance Table
## 
## Model 1: ABUND ~ s(L.AREA, k = 4, fx = TRUE) + GRAZE
## Model 2: ABUND ~ s(L.AREA, k = 4, fx = TRUE) + fGRAZE
##   Resid. Df Resid. Dev Df Deviance      F  Pr(>F)  
## 1        51     1869.0                             
## 2        48     1543.1  3   325.93 3.3796 0.02565 *
## ---
## Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1
```

Both AIC and the $F$-test suggest that the model with GRAZE as a factor provides a significantly better fit than the model with a linear effect of GRAZE ($F_{3,48} = 3.38, p = 0.026$).

As a final note, Zuur et al. (p.550) observe that "the non-linear L.AREA effect is mainly due to two large patches. It would be useful to sample more of this type of patch in the future."  (Note the rug plots in any of the plots of the area effect above.)
